#Dog Party
This project was to create a site similar to the comp. A main focus being the use of clean HTML structure and tagging as well as style the site as visually close to the comp as possible. Upon my next iteration I would like to add media queries to adjust the columns for smaller screens as well as the nav bar. I would also like to add the optional Javascript functionality.
